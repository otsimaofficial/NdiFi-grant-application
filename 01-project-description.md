# 01. Project Description

## **Goal and Problem Solved**

Uniswap V2 is a decentralized, Ethereum-based exchange protocol enabling the automated trading of ERC-20 tokens via smart-contract liquidity pools. Users can swap tokens directly without intermediaries, deposit tokens into liquidity pools, and earn fees proportionally. Uniswap V2 extends the automated market maker (AMM) concept, introducing flexible token pairing, flash swaps, and robust on-chain price oracle capabilities.

## **Closest Competitor**

The closest competitor is Bancor, an earlier automated market maker protocol that similarly provides decentralized token trading using liquidity pools and smart contracts. Bancor pioneered the AMM model; however, it requires tokens to be paired with its native token (BNT), introducing additional friction and intermediary dependencies.

## **Unique Differentiators**

* **Token Pair Flexibility:** Unlike Bancor, Uniswap V2 enables liquidity pools consisting of any two ERC-20 tokens directly, without requiring a native intermediary token. This significantly enhances liquidity, usability, and efficiency.

* **Price Oracle Capability:** Uniswap V2 incorporates decentralized on-chain price oracle functionalities, allowing external decentralized applications to securely reference token prices without reliance on off-chain data feeds, enhancing security and composability across DeFi applications.

* **Flash Swaps:** Uniswap V2 introduces flash swaps, allowing developers to borrow tokens instantly and execute arbitrage or refinancing opportunities atomically within a single Ethereum transaction, greatly expanding possibilities for sophisticated decentralized financial strategies.

* **Censorship Resistance and Security:** The decentralized nature of Uniswap V2's smart contracts and liquidity pools eliminates single points of failure and custodial risk, promoting resilience against censorship, hacks, or downtime that traditional centralized exchanges suffer.

Uniswap V2 stands uniquely positioned to be the foundational infrastructure for decentralized token exchanges, promoting open finance innovation and accessibility.
