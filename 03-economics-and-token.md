# 03. Ndi-Fi: Economics and Token

## **Protocol Economics**

The Ndi-Fi protocol is designed with a self-reinforcing economic flywheel to incentivize participation and drive growth. Its primary revenue sources are lending origination fees and excess vault yield. These revenues are used to provide competitive yields to depositors and to fund NDI token rewards for active participants.

## **Token Role**

The NdiPoint (NDI) token is the central utility and rewards token of the Ndi-Fi ecosystem. Its core role is to incentivize participation in the platform's key activities, such as staking, lending, and borrowing. The token is also designed with future governance in mind, where NDI holders could vote on key economic parameters to manage and grow the protocol.

## **Tokenomics Overview**

* **Token Name:** NdiPoint (NDI)
* **Supply Distribution:** The NDI token has a hard cap of 1,000,000,000 NDI. An initial supply of 100,000,000 NDI is minted at deployment, with the remaining 900,000,000 NDI reserved for future distribution as rewards. New tokens can only be created by addresses with the `MINTER_ROLE` or `REWARD_DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE`.
* **Token Utility:** The NDI token's primary utility is for rewards and incentives. It is distributed to users who stake assets or participate in lending and borrowing activities to grow the ecosystem.
* **Economic Incentive:** Ndi-Fi's economic design centers on the **flywheel effect**. By offering competitive Annual Percentage Yield (APY) and NDI rewards, the protocol attracts more liquidity. This increased liquidity facilitates more lending activity, which in turn generates more revenue through fees and excess yield. This revenue can then be used to fund more rewards, restarting the cycle.
