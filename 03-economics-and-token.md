# 03. Economics and Token

## Protocol Economics

The liquidity providers (LPs) earn fees generated by the trading prools. The fees are disbursed real-time by appreciated LP tokens. The fees can be set by the pool creators. The default fee will be set to 0.3%. 

## Token Role

Uniswap V2 initially functions without a dedicated governance token, relying solely on liquidity pool tokens (LP tokens). LP tokens represent proportional shares of deposited liquidity and entitle holders to earn transaction fees collected from token swaps.

However, to enable decentralized governance, the introduction of a dedicated governance token (UNI) would allow holders to propose, vote on protocol upgrades, parameter adjustments, and fee structures.

## Tokenomics Overview

* **Token Name:** UNI (proposed governance token)
* **Supply Distribution:**

  * Community allocation: 60% (distributed via liquidity mining and user participation)
  * Team allocation: 21.5% (vested over 4 years)
  * Investor allocation: 17.8% (vested over 4 years)
  * Advisor allocation: 0.7% (vested over 4 years)
* **Token Utility:** Governance rights, enabling decentralized decision-making
* **Economic Incentive:** LP tokens incentivize liquidity provision by distributing fees (0.3% per swap) proportionally to liquidity providers, directly aligning user incentives with protocol growth.
