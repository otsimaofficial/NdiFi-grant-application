# 06. Ndi-Fi: Project Roadmap & Milestones

## Phase 1: Foundation & Mainnet Launch (Q4 2025)

**Goal:** To securely launch the core protocol, establish a foundational user base, and bootstrap initial liquidity.

### Key Milestones:

- **✅ Complete Security Audits:** Engage multiple third-party auditing firms to conduct a comprehensive security review of all core smart contracts.
- **🚀 Mainnet Deployment:** Deploy the finalized and audited versions of `NdiPoint`, `NdiFiVault`, `NdiFiStaking`, and `NdiFiLending` contracts to the Ethereum mainnet.
- **🌐 Launch dApp (v1):** Release a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly web interface (dApp) that allows users to interact with all features of the protocol.
- **💧 Liquidity Mining Program:** Initiate a targeted liquidity mining program, distributing NDI rewards to early users who deposit assets into the `NdiFiVault` and take out loans. This is critical for bootstrapping the protocol's TVL.
- **📚 Publish Documentation:** Release comprehensive documentation, including the Project Description, Technical Analysis, Tokenomics, and Market Analysis to ensure full transparency.

## Phase 2: Ecosystem Expansion & Feature Growth (Q1-Q2 2026)

**Goal:** To enhance the protocol's capabilities to attract a broader range of users and increase its competitiveness.

### Key Milestones:

- **🔗 Multi-Collateral Lending:** Upgrade the `NdiFiLending` contract to accept a wider variety of crypto assets as collateral, moving beyond a single collateral type.
- **📈 Dynamic Interest Rate Model:** Implement a more sophisticated interest rate model for lending that adjusts dynamically based on the utilization rate of the `NdiFiVault`, replacing the initial fixed-fee model.
- **🧠 Advanced Vault Strategies:** Introduce new, optional strategies for the `NdiFiVault`. This will evolve the vault into a true yield aggregator that can seek returns from other protocols, not just its internal lending platform.
- **🌉 Layer 2 (L2) Deployment:** Research and execute a deployment on a major Ethereum Layer 2 (such as Arbitrum or Optimism) to provide users with a faster and lower-cost alternative.

## Phase 3: Decentralization & Community Governance (Q3-Q4 2026)

**Goal:** To transition control of the protocol from the founding team to the NDI token holders, establishing a fully functional Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

### Key Milestones:

- **🗳️ Launch Governance Module:** Introduce a governance portal where users can stake their NDI tokens to receive voting power (e.g., in a veToken model).
- **📜 Establish the Ndi-Fi DAO:** Formally create the Ndi-Fi DAO and publish a clear governance framework and constitution.
- **🔑 Transfer Ownership:** Begin the process of transferring the `owner` and administrative roles of the core smart contracts to the DAO's governance contract. This will place control over protocol parameters in the hands of the community.
- **💰 Community-Managed Treasury:** Route all protocol revenue (origination fees, vault profits) to a treasury wallet controlled by the Ndi-Fi DAO.
- **🗣️ First Governance Proposals:** Enable the community to create and vote on proposals to adjust key economic levers, such as the `collateralFactor`, `apy`, and `stakingCap`.

## Phase 4: Long-Term Vision & Self-Sustainment (2027 and Beyond)

**Goal:** To foster a self-sustaining, innovative, and fully community-governed DeFi ecosystem.

### Key Milestones:

- **🌍 Real-World Assets (RWA):** Research and develop frameworks for accepting tokenized real-world assets (such as real estate or private credit) as collateral, bridging the gap between DeFi and traditional finance.
- **💡 Ecosystem Grants Program:** The DAO will fund promising projects and developers who want to build new applications and services on top of the Ndi-Fi protocol.
- **🛡️ Under-collateralized Lending:** Explore and develop identity-based or reputation-based lending products, which represent the next frontier in decentralized finance.
- **♾️ Continuous Innovation:** The DAO will foster an environment of continuous research and development, ensuring the Ndi-Fi protocol remains relevant and competitive in the ever-evolving DeFi landscape.
